This project is an updated version of my other repo DFOPriceWatcher. The purpose of this project is to refamiliarize myself with Java 11 and JavaFX 11, learn how to compile Java projects with Gradle, and understand how to use the World of Warcraft API. This project will use h2 1.4.200 as the database.
